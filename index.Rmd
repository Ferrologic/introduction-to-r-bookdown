# Prerequisites

During the workshops you will use R on both a cloud platform and on your own computer. 

If you have a previous R version installed on your computer we recommend that you update both R and RStudio. 

This book is written in R with the package `bookdown` built by Yihui Xie. You can find out more about `bookdown` [here](https://bookdown.org/)
